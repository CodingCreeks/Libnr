# Angular 7, Angular Material and NGXS state management pattern

### This is a simple project showcasing another way to manage state in an Angular application using the NGXS state management pattern.

### NGXS is modeled after the CQRS which is a pattern that both Redux and NGRX implement. 
### The advantages that NGXS gives is that it reduces the boilerplate, it enables us to use dependency injection, and it enables us to use promises when we need them :).
