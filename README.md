# Angular 7, Angular Material and NGXS state management pattern

#### This is a simple project showcasing another way to manage state in an Angular application using the NGXS state management pattern.
---

NGXS is modeled after the CQRS which is a pattern that both Redux and NGRX implement. <br>
The advantages that NGXS gives are: 
1. It reduces the boilerplate, 
2. It enables us to use dependency injection, 
3. and it enables us to use promises when we need them :).
